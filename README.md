# Torque_Calculator

This Python script calculates the required torque and speed for a motorized vehicle based on various input parameters such 
as vehicle mass, wheel diameter, number of wheels and motors, rolling friction coefficient between wheel and floor, system efficiency, 
floor slope, operating speed and conditions, stopping accuracy, and safety factor. 
The script also calculates the load inertia and load force. The results are printed to the console in a human-readable format.
